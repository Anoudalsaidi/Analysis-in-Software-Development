The Analysis Phase 
1. What is the Analysis Phase and Why is it Important?

The analysis phase is the step where we understand the problem and figure out what the software should do.
It is important because it helps the team know exactly what to build before starting work.
This avoids mistakes, saves time, and makes sure the final product meets the user’s needs.

2. Steps of the Analysis Phase (Simple)
a. Gathering Requirements

Talk to users and stakeholders to collect information about what they want.
Methods: interviews, surveys, observing how they work, checking current systems.

b. Analyzing Requirements

Review the gathered information to make sure it is clear, possible to do, and does not have any contradictions.
Decide which requirements are most important.

c. Documenting Requirements

Write everything in a clear, organized document (like an SRS).
This helps designers and developers know exactly what to create.

d. Validating Requirements

Share the document with users to confirm everything is correct.
Changes are made if needed.

3. Deliverables / Outputs

At the end of this phase, you should have:

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Diagrams like use cases, flowcharts, or data flow diagrams

A clear description of what the system will do

Approval from stakeholders on the requirements

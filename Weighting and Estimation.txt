# Weighting and Estimation

## 1. Story Point Estimation Techniques
Story points measure the relative effort, complexity, and risk of a user story. They are not exact time estimates.

- **Fibonacci Sequence:** Assign points using numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. Larger numbers = more complex stories.
- **Relative Sizing:** Compare a new story to a previously completed story. Double the effort → double points.
- **Ideal Days/Hours:** Optional mapping to time, but focus is on relative effort.

## 2. Estimation Methods

### Planning Poker
- Each team member selects a card with their estimate (Fibonacci numbers).
- Cards are revealed simultaneously.
- Discuss differences and re-estimate until consensus.
- Encourages discussion and shared understanding.

### T-Shirt Sizing
- Categorize stories as XS, S, M, L, XL based on complexity.
- XS/S = simple, L/XL = complex.
- Can later be converted to numerical story points.

### Dot Voting / Affinity Estimation
- Group stories quickly into size categories using team consensus.
- Useful for large backlogs.

## 3. Weighting User Stories
Weight stories by considering:

1. **Complexity:** Difficulty to implement (higher complexity → higher points)
2. **Priority:** Importance for business or customer satisfaction
3. **Business Value:** Impact on users or revenue

Example:

| User Story          | Complexity | Priority | Business Value | Weighted Score |
|--------------------|------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Login Functionality | 3          | High     | High           | 9              |
| UI Theme Update     | 1          | Low      | Medium         | 2              |
| Payment Gateway     | 5          | High     | High           | 15             |

Weighted scores help decide the order of stories in sprints.
